*ICP
- converges only if starting poses are close enough
- estimating motion: how does pseudoinverse ensure that the first two entries in the last row are 0?
- value of threshold?

*RPM
- final correspondences always one-to-one, unlike ICP
- what is ep?
- works well in presence of noise, outliers
- determines both correspondence and pose simultaneously
- gamma and alpha can be set using max likelihood (46)
